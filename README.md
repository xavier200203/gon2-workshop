## Introduction

In this workshop we will be working with the [ISC721](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-721-nft-transfer) in order to transfer Non-Fungible Token between different testnets(IRISnet,Uptick) with nodejs SDK.

This repository contains all the instructions If you want to participate in gon hackathon. Please follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete the workshop.

This workshop's primary goal is to better understand the ISC721 nft transfer protocol and how packets are relayed from one chain to another using the IBC primitives.
